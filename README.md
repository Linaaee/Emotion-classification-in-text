# Description
My Moroccan Catalogues( Mon Catalogue Marocain) is a mobile application capable of detecting the emotions of the clients through their comments. This app was the subject of my Bachelors thesis. I went through several phases to create this project.
The major ones are the following:
1. Assembling the database
2. Text pre-processing
3. Application of the different models of word embedding 
4. Application of different classification methods based on Machine/Deep learning
5. Saving the model with the highest accuracy
