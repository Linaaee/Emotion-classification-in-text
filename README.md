# Description
My Moroccan Catalogues( Mon Catalogue Marocain) is a mobile application capable of detecting the emotions of the clients through their comments. This app was the subject of my Bachelors thesis. I went through several phases to create this project.
The major ones are the following:
1. Assembling the database
2. Text pre-processing
3. Application of the different models of word embedding 
4. Application of different classification methods based on Machine/Deep learning
5. Saving the model with the highest accuracy


# Database info 
The Database is in Arabic, it was assembeled using various technogologies (web scraping, chatito, translation of the Isear dataset using python....)
It contains 29952 comments from customers about different themes with different labels (Joy, Anger, Sadness, none, surprise,sympathy, love, fear) which are distributed as the following:
